_Hands-on Lab: Creating Visualizations Using Cognos Analytics_


### Data Used
The dataset used in this lab comes from here in the IBM Accelerator Catalog. The Terms of use for such are located at https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/. We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully, used the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.  

### Assignment Scenario
As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to build out a dashboard to allow you to understand your sales and service departments.

  
### Methods and Tools Used
- IBM Cognos Analytics
> This lab is a practice exercise in IBM Cognos, showing the highest-profit dealers, total profit and quantity sold, also the average quantity sold. It demonstrates skills in building KPI cards, bar charts, and data visualizations using Cognos Analytics.
